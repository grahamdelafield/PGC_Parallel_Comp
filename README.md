Repository for code and datafiles associated with Manuscript (citation to come).



## Data Availability
Thanks for checking our this github. The code contained here is intended to supplement the manuscript associated with our experiment and to be viewed/used by readers. Most of the data needed to run these notebooks is already included in the repository, meaning you can get started with a simple download. However, since the file size of the .mzXML data is too large, these files will have to be retrieved from _______ . As such, when looking through these notebooks, you will see the markdown cells indicating when/if you need to provide the path to that mzXML data. If you experience any trouble in accomplishing this, please contact me using the information below. 


## Getting Started
This repo uses python and jupyter notebooks. If you do not have either of these installed, please read further here: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html


Easiest way to use these notebooks is to clone/fork the repo and then install requirements.
```
git clone https:/github.com/grahamdelafield/PGC_Parallel_Comp

# navigate to the new directory
cd C:/user/some/path/to/directory/PGC_Parallel_Comp

# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code Use
This code is provided 'as is' and may be modified for personal use. If you are interested in learning more about the main packages used throughout, I would suggest reading more on Pyteomics and Altair.
